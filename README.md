# RustFinalProjet

Implementation of a graph data type using rust. 

Features:
Add nodes (no checks to see if nodes are being added in sequential order)
Add connections (checks to make sure that both nodes have already been added to graph)
  Note: connections cannot be edited once they have been added to the graph
In progress: adding implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm
  got some funky issues when trying to access the nodes/making it recursive, but at this point I probably would have been forced to restart the entire project.
