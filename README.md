# RustFinalProjet

Implementation of a graph data type using rust. 

Features: \n
Add nodes (no checks to see if nodes are being added in sequential order) \n
Add connections (checks to make sure that both nodes have already been added to graph) \n\t
  Note: connections cannot be edited once they have been added to the graph \n
In progress: adding implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\t
  got some funky issues when trying to access the nodes/making it recursive, but at this point I probably would have been forced to restart the entire project.
